# Code Refactor Starter Code
In this challenge I started with changing the title to Horiseon.
I then changed the divs to sections and articles.
Indented in appropriate spots to make the HTML more readable.
added alt commands to the images for accessibility.
in css combined several classes together and reflected that change in the html.
fixed the link for the search engine optimization tab to direct user to proper section.
changed the background and the benefits section to be even with the other toolbar
